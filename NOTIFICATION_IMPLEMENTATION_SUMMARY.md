## 🎨 How to Use New Methods

### **In Control Pages (e.g., AirfareControl.razor)**

```csharp
private async Task MarkAsValid(string transactionId)
{
    try
    {
        // 1. Mark transaction as valid
        await TransactionService.MarkAsValidAsync(transactionId);
        
        // 2. Get transaction details
        var transaction = filteredTransactions.FirstOrDefault(t => t.TransactionId == transactionId);
        
        if (transaction != null)
        {
            // 3. ✅ NOTIFY EMPLOYEE
            await NotificationService.NotifyEmployeeTransactionValidatedAsync(
                employeeEmail: transaction.Email,
                transactionId: transaction.TransactionId,
                categoryName: "Airfare", // or transaction.Category.Name
                amount: transaction.AmountUSD ?? 0
            );
        }
        
        // 4. Update UI
        await LoadTransactions();
        ShowAlert("Success", "Transaction marked as valid and employee notified", AlertDialog.AlertType.Success);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        ShowAlert("Error", $"Error: {ex.Message}", AlertDialog.AlertType.Error);
    }
}
```

### **For Generating Messages**

```csharp
private async Task GenerateMessage(Transaction transaction)
{
    try
    {
        // 1. Generate message template
        var message = BuildMessageTemplate(transaction);
        
        // 2. Copy to clipboard
        await CopyToClipboard(message);
        
        // 3. ✅ NOTIFY EMPLOYEE
        await NotificationService.NotifyEmployeeInquiryAsync(
            employeeEmail: transaction.Email,
            transactionId: transaction.TransactionId,
            categoryName: "Airfare", // or category name
            inquiryReason: "Please check your email for details."
        );
        
        ShowAlert("Success", "Message copied and employee notified", AlertDialog.AlertType.Success);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        ShowAlert("Error", $"Error: {ex.Message}", AlertDialog.AlertType.Error);
    }
