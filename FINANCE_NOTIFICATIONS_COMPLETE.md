## 🎨 Notification Icons & Colors

| Action | Icon | Color | Priority |
|--------|------|-------|----------|
| Trip Validated | ✅ | Green (Success) | Normal |

## ✅ Error Handling

All notification code is wrapped in try-catch blocks:
- Notifications never block main operations
- Failed notifications are logged to console
- Users see success message even if notification fails
- Operations complete successfully regardless of notification status

Example:
```csharp
try
{
    await _notificationService.NotifyEmployeeTripValidatedAsync(...);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Failed to send notification: {ex.Message}");
}
```
