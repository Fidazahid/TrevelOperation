# Notification Debugging Guide

## Changes Made

### Issue Identified
The `GetFinanceTeamEmailsAsync` method was only looking in the **Headcount** table, but Finance users are stored in the **User** table.

### Fix Applied
Updated `NotificationService.GetFinanceTeamEmailsAsync()` to:
1. **First** check the Users table for users with Role = "Finance" and IsActive = true
2. **Then** fallback to Headcount table if no users found
3. Added extensive debug logging throughout the notification flow

### Debug Logging Added
Now you'll see console output showing:
- When a transaction is created with category and amount
- The threshold check for Finance notification
- Whether the transaction meets the threshold
- All Finance team members found
- Each notification being created
- Any errors with full stack trace

## Testing Steps

### 1. Build the Solution
```powershell
dotnet build TrevelOperation.sln
```

### 2. Run the Application
Start the WPF app and watch the console output

### 3. Create a Meal Transaction as Employee
1. Login as employee (e.g., `john.doe@wsc.com` / `emp123`)
2. Create a new transaction:
   - Category: **Meals**
   - Amount: **$1200** (or any amount â‰¥ $80)
   - Fill in other required fields
3. Save the transaction

### 4. Check Console Output
You should see messages like:
```
[TransactionService] Transaction created - Category: Meals, Amount: $1200
[TransactionService] Threshold for Meals: $80, Actual: $1200
[TransactionService] Notifying Finance team for Meals transaction
[NotificationService] NotifyFinanceTeamAsync called
[NotificationService] Getting Finance team emails...
[NotificationService] Found 3 Finance users in Users table
[NotificationService] Finance team emails: admin@corporate.com, martina.popinsk@wsc.com, maayan.chesler@wsc.com
[NotificationService] Found 3 finance team members
[NotificationService] Creating notification for: admin@corporate.com
[NotificationService] Notification created successfully for admin@corporate.com
[NotificationService] Creating notification for: martina.popinsk@wsc.com
[NotificationService] Notification created successfully for martina.popinsk@wsc.com
[NotificationService] Creating notification for: maayan.chesler@wsc.com
[NotificationService] Notification created successfully for maayan.chesler@wsc.com
[NotificationService] All Finance team notifications sent
[TransactionService] Finance team notification sent successfully
```

### 5. Login as Finance User
1. Logout from employee account
2. Login as Finance user (e.g., `martina.popinsk@wsc.com` / `finance123`)
3. Navigate to **Notifications** page
4. You should see the notification for the new meal transaction

### 6. Verify Notification Details
The notification should show:
- **Icon**: ðŸ’¼
- **Title**: "New Meals Transaction Requires Review"
- **Message**: "Employee john.doe@wsc.com submitted a Meals expense of $1,200.00. Review required."
- **Action Button**: "Take Action" â†’ redirects to `/data-integrity/controls/meals`
- **Badge**: "New" (if unread)

## Finance Users with Notification Access

Based on `UserManagementService.cs`, these users have Finance role:
1. `admin@corporate.com` - Finance Department
2. `martina.popinsk@wsc.com` - Finance Department
3. `maayan.chesler@wsc.com` - Finance Department
4. `ceo@wsc.com` - Executive Department
5. `cfo@wsc.com` - Executive Department
6. `cto@wsc.com` - Executive Department

## Notification Thresholds

Finance team gets notified when transactions exceed:
- **Meals**: â‰¥ $80
- **Lodging**: â‰¥ $100
- **Client Entertainment**: â‰¥ $50
- **Other Categories**: â‰¥ $200

Additionally, **all** users get notified for high-value transactions â‰¥ $1000.

## Troubleshooting

### No Console Output
- Make sure you're running in Debug mode
- Check that the application is writing to the console window

### No Notifications Showing
1. Check if Finance users exist in the database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Role = 'Finance' AND IsActive = 1
   ```

2. Check if notifications were created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Notifications ORDER BY CreatedAt DESC LIMIT 10
   ```

3. Verify you're logged in with the correct Finance email

### Notifications Created but Not Visible
- Ensure `currentUserEmail` in Notifications.razor matches the logged-in user
- Check the LoadNotifications() method is being called on page load
- Verify AuthenticationService is returning the correct email

## Next Steps

Once notifications are working:
1. Remove or reduce debug logging (make it conditional on debug flag)
2. Test all other Data Integrity Control pages
3. Test bidirectional flow (Finance marks as valid â†’ Employee gets notified)
4. Implement remaining phases (Trip notifications, Policy compliance)
