## 🛡️ Data Integrity Controls

### Purpose
Automated quality checks to identify transactions needing review or correction. These controls save 70% of manual review time by highlighting only problematic transactions.

---

### Control 1: Airfare Control

**What It Does:**
Ensures all airfare transactions have cabin class assigned (required for tax compliance)

**Displays:**
- Airfare transactions WITHOUT cabin class
- OR airfare with premium cabins (Business/First) for review

**Why It Matters:**
- Tax regulations require cabin class documentation
- Premium cabin usage may require approval
- Missing data blocks trip validation

**Information Shown:**
- Transaction ID, Date, Traveler
- Vendor (airline), Amount USD

- **Participants (EDITABLE)** - Add internal/external attendees
- Category (EDITABLE) - Change to "Client Entertainment" if applicable

**Actions:**
- **Add Participants** - Select employees or add external emails
- **Mark as Valid** - Confirms meal is legitimate
- **Update Category** - Change to Client Entertainment if needed
- **Generate Message** - 3 email templates:
  1. External participants detected → Request full attendee list
  2. Internal participants only → Confirm shared expense policy
  3. No participants → Request information

**Typical Workflow:**
1. Finance sees meal $145 at steakhouse
2. Clicks "Add Participants"
3. Adds 2 external clients + 1 internal employee
4. Changes category to "Client Entertainment"
5. Generates email to confirm attendees

**What It Does:**
Ensures all client entertainment transactions have participant information (required for tax deductions)

**Displays:**
- Transactions categorized as "Client Entertainment"
- Participants not validated (empty or incomplete)

**Why It Matters:**
- Tax regulations require attendee names for entertainment deductions
- Must distinguish internal vs. external participants
- Future audits may request documentation

**Information Shown:**

**Email Template:**
> "The following transaction was categorized as Client entertainment. To comply with tax reporting requirements, could you please provide the names and email addresses of all participants (both internal WSC employees and external customers/prospects)? This information is required for proper documentation and may be needed in the event of a future tax audit."

**Typical Workflow:**
1. Finance sees entertainment $220 at restaurant
2. Clicks "Add Participants"
3. Selects 2 internal employees from dropdown
4. Adds 3 external client emails manually
5. Clicks "Validate Participants"
6. Transaction ready for tax reporting

**Statistics:**

---

### Control 5: Other Control

**What It Does:**
Helps categorize transactions marked as "Other" (proper categorization required for reporting)

  - Tax reporting
  - Budget analysis
  - Policy compliance
  - Travel spend reports

**Information Shown:**
- Transaction ID, Date, Traveler
- Vendor, Location, Amount USD
- **Trip Info** (if linked) - Shows trip name + dates for context
- **Category (EDITABLE)** - Change to proper category

**Actions:**
- **Update Category** - Select from dropdown:

  - If truly "Other", mark as valid
- **Generate Message** - Email template asking: "What is the nature of this transaction?"

**Email Template:**
> "The system wasn't able to categorize this transaction and we need to select a proper category for tax purposes. What is the nature of this transaction?"
> 
> **If linked to trip:** Includes trip name and dates for context

**Typical Workflow:**
1. Finance sees 15 "Other" transactions
2. Reviews vendor names
3. "Uber" → Changes to Transportation
4. "Verizon" → Changes to Communication  
5. "Conference Registration" → Keeps as Other, marks valid
6. All 15 categorized in 6 minutes

**Statistics:**
- Uncategorized count
- Total "Other" amount
- By traveler (who has most uncategorized)

---

### Control 6: Missing Documentation Control

**What It Does:**
Identifies transactions without receipts/documentation and prioritizes by urgency

**Displays:**
- Transactions with NO document URL
- Prioritized by amount + age

**Why It Matters:**
- Company policy requires documentation for all expenses
- Tax audits may request receipts (retention period: 7 years)
- Missing docs = compliance risk
- Older transactions = harder to recover documentation

**Priority Algorithm:**
1. **Critical (Red):**
   - High amount (≥$100) + Old (>60 days) OR
   - Very high amount (≥$300) regardless of age

2. **High (Orange):**
   - Medium amount (≥$50) + Old (>30 days) OR
   - High amount (≥$150) regardless of age

3. **Medium (Yellow):**
   - Any amount + Old (>30 days) OR
   - Medium amount (≥$75) regardless of age

4. **Low (Gray):**
   - Recent + Low amount

**Information Shown:**
- Transaction ID, Date, **Age (days)**
- Traveler, Vendor, Category
- Amount USD, **Priority Badge**
- Action buttons

**Actions:**
- **Request Documentation** - Generates urgency-based email:
  - **Urgent (>60 days):** "URGENT - Missing Receipt Required" with escalation note
  - **Important (>30 days):** "Important - Missing Receipt Required"
  - **Standard (≤30 days):** Standard documentation request
- **Upload Document** - Finance can upload on behalf of traveler
- **Mark as Exempt** - For transactions not requiring receipts (requires approval)

**Filters:**
- Priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Age (Recent <30 days, Old >30 days, Urgent >60 days)
- Amount range (High ≥$100, Medium $50-$100, Low <$50)
- Category, Owner, Search

**Typical Workflow:**
1. Finance filters "Critical Priority" → 5 transactions
2. Sends urgent email requests (auto-generated)
3. Filters "High Priority" → 12 transactions
4. Sends important email requests
5. Follows up after 3 days
6. Compliance rate improves from 75% to 92%

**Statistics:**
- Missing documents count
- Amount at risk (total without docs)
- High-value count (≥$100)
- Compliance rate (%)

---

### Control 7: Matching Engine

**Purpose:** Link transactions to trips (manual or automatic)

**Two Modes:**

#### Manual Matching
**When to Use:** Known trip, need to link specific transactions

**Workflow:**
1. Select trip from dropdown (all trips listed)
2. Set date range buffer (±0-30 days)
3. System shows unlinked transactions in range
4. Select transactions with checkboxes
5. Click "Link Selected" → Transactions linked to trip
6. Audit log records all links

**Typical Use Case:**
> "Trip 'Berlin Conference' created manually. Finance selects trip, sees 12 unlinked transactions in date range. Selects 8 relevant transactions (excludes 4 unrelated), links in 2 minutes."

#### Automatic Suggestions
**When to Use:** Let AI suggest best transaction-trip matches

**How It Works:**
1. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - Email match (required)
   - Date proximity (±1 day = 40 points, ±3 days = 30 points, etc.)
   - External trip ID match (30 points)
   - Category relevance (Airfare = 20, Lodging = 15, etc.)
   - Booking date match (10 points)

2. **Confidence Scoring:**
   - **High (80%+):** Strong match, review quickly
   - **Medium (50-79%):** Possible match, verify details
   - **Low (<50%):** Weak match, likely incorrect

3. **Review Process:**
   - System shows suggestion cards
   - Each card displays:
     - Trip details
     - Suggested transactions with individual confidence
     - Total amount
     - Matching reasons
   - Finance approves or rejects each suggestion

**Typical Use Case:**
> "System suggests 15 trip-transaction matches. Finance reviews 3 high-confidence (82%, 88%, 91%) in 1 minute, approves all. Reviews 8 medium-confidence, approves 6, rejects 2. 65 transactions linked automatically in 5 minutes."

---

### Control 8: Split Engine

**Purpose:** Divide transactions among multiple participants

**What It Does:**
- Detects transactions with multiple participants
- Suggests equal or custom splits
- Creates new transaction records for each participant
- Maintains reference to original transaction

**Automatic Detection:**
- Transactions with Participants field populated
- High-value transactions (likely shared)
- Confidence score based on:
  - Number of participants
  - Transaction amount
  - Category (Meals, Entertainment high probability)

**Split Options:**

1. **Equal Split**
   - Divides amount evenly among participants
   - Example: $120 meal, 3 people = $40 each

2. **Custom Split**
   - Manual amount per participant
   - Validates: Sum must equal original amount
   - Example: $150 meal = $75 (employee) + $50 (client 1) + $25 (client 2)

3. **Percentage Split**
   - Percentage per participant
   - Validates: Sum must equal 100%
   - Example: $200 = 60% + 25% + 15%

**Actions:**
- **Accept Split** - Creates new transaction records
- **Edit Split** - Modify amounts before applying
- **Reject** - Keep as single transaction

**Typical Use Case:**
> "System detects client dinner $240 with 4 participants (1 employee + 3 clients). Suggests equal split $60 each. Finance edits: Employee $80 (2 drinks), Clients $160/3 = $53.33 each. Accepts split. 4 transaction records created, original marked as split."

## 💰 Tax Compliance

### Tax Exposure Calculation

**Formula:**

```
Meals Exposure:
  IF MealsPerDay > MealsCap:
    Exposure = Duration × (MealsPerDay - MealsCap)

Lodging Exposure:
  IF LodgingPerNight > LodgingCap:
    Exposure = Duration × (LodgingPerNight - LodgingCap)

Airfare Exposure:
  IF CabinClass IN ('Business', 'First'):
    Flag = TRUE (requires approval/justification)

Total Tax Exposure = Meals Exposure + Lodging Exposure
```

**Example:**

```
Trip: NYC Business Meeting
Duration: 5 days
Meals Total: $450 ($90/day)
Lodging Total: $1,200 ($240/night)

Tax Rules (2025, USA, WSC US):
Meals Cap: $75/day
Lodging Cap: $200/night
Tax Shield: 15%

Calculation:
Meals Exposure = 5 × ($90 - $75) = $75
Lodging Exposure = 5 × ($240 - $200) = $200
Total Exposure = $75 + $200 = $275

Tax Impact = $275 × 15% = $41.25
```

### Compliance Reports

1. **Trip Validation Report**
   - All trips with tax exposure
   - Amount exceeding caps
   - Premium cabin usage
   - Missing documentation

2. **Annual Tax Report**
   - Total exposure by fiscal year
   - By country and subsidiary
   - By employee/department
   - Export for tax filing

3. **Policy Compliance Dashboard**
   - Violations by type
   - By severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Approval status
   - Outstanding issues
